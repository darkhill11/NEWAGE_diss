! 5. AGGREGATED ENDOWMENTS
!
!   In this section, the default endowment aggregation for GTAP
!   version 5 has been specified. Users may change the aggregation
!   following these rules:
!       a) Additional lines may be added as needed and unused lines
!          should be removed.
!       b) If the aggregated database is to be used with the GTAP
!          model, one of the aggregated endowment names should be
!          "capital", since this plays a key role in the model.
!       c) Specify the classification of the aggregated factor,
!          whether sluggish or mobile. There should be at least one
!          sluggish and at least one mobile factor.
!       d) Specify a value for the elasticity of transformation,
!          "ETRAE".  A number must be given for all endowments,
!          mobile or sluggish, though its value matters only for
!          the sluggish endowments.
