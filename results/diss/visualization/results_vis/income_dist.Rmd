This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(extrafont)
library(showtext)

loadfonts(device = "win")
```

```{r}
#read emplyment data from results
income_dis <- read_csv("income_dist.csv")
```

```{r}
income_filter <- filter(income_dis, category != "h_share", category != "total_share")

h_share <- filter(income_dis, category == "h_share")
```

```{r}
income_plot <- ggplot(income_filter, aes(x = quintile, y = Value, fill = category))

income_plot +
  geom_bar(stat='identity') + 
  geom_point(data=h_share, mapping = aes(x = quintile, y =Value), color = "blue") +

  facet_wrap(~region, ncol = 3) +
  scale_y_continuous(
    name = "Share of income",
    sec.axis = sec_axis(~.*5, name = "total income proportion \ncompared to Q1") 

  )


```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
